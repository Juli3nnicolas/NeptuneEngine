Every new physical platform must have a Core, HighLevel and Project
directory. 

The signification of each directory name is as follows:
- Core: Contains basic modules only. A High level module is made up of
core modules.

- High Level: Any module that relies on a core module.

- Project: Any files that permit the users to build the engine on 
their machine.
