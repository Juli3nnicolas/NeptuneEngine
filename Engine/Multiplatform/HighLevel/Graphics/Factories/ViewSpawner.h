/// \Class		This class creates View instances. It is important to know that every instance
///				will share the same data, whether generated by one of the public methods or
///				passed by the user as a parameter. It is also important to note that the users
///				is responsible for managing their data and make sure they are available for
///				all views created by the same spawner.
///
/// \Note		This class can be seen as an highly coupled factory. In the sense that every produced
///				objects always depend on the factory and the parameters provided by the user to exist. 
///
/// \Attention	The layout position 0 in GLSL shaders is reserved for the vertices' position.
///
/// \Warning	Unless stated otherwise, all the graphics programs and graphics-program input-parameters provided to
///				this class are not copied. They are referenced using pointers. Meaning you are responsible for managing 
///				these data and keep them available (allocated) for this class at all times.	
///				For the sake of performance, this class will not manage any of your data.
///				If you want a simpler behavior, please have a look at the ViewFactory subclasses.
